This is code made with Quasar Alpha from openrouter.ai used via API within Open WEBUI<br>
I wanted to create a google notebookLM clone<br>
Not 100% a clone and needed a break from prompting and this is what it did so far.<br>
Still very buggy. Summarization is meh at best and still requires you to refresh or restart the app but for a "stealth LM release" not bad.<br>
This assumes you know how to work with python in windows<br>

Step 1: create a folder<br>
Step 2: place app.py in folder<br>
Step 3: Windows side: open a command prompt in that folder<br>
Step 4: create a virtual enviorment for python<br>
Step 5: Activate virtual python enviorment<br>
Step 6: run pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community chromadb pypdf beautifulsoup4 python-docx<br>
Step 7: run streamlit run app.py<br>
Enjoy<br>
