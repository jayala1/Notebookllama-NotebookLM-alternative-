This is code made with Quasar Alpha from openrouter.ai used via API within Open WEBUI
I wanted to create a google notebookLM clone
Not 100% a clone and needed a break from prompting and this is what it did so far.
Still very buggy. Summarization is meh at best and still requires you to refresh or restart the app but for a "stealth LM release" not bad.
This assumes you know how to work with python in windows

Step 1: create a folder<br>
Step 2: place app.py in folder<br>
Step 3: Windows side: open a command prompt in that folder<br>
Step 4: create a virtual enviorment for python
Step 5: Activate virtual python enviorment
Step 6: run pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community chromadb pypdf beautifulsoup4 python-docx
Step 7: run streamlit run app.py
Enjoy
